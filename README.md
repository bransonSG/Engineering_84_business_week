### Q&A:
* What is DevOps and what is the benefit of using it?  
  ***DevOps is the combination of development and opperations, previously when these roles***  
  ***were seperate inter-team conflicts were common place. However when combined the service***  
  ***life cycle becomes more efficient as the whole team is working together instead of***  
  ***lowering inter-team disputes and increasing the rate of development.***  
  
* What is Agile and what is the benefit of implementing it?  
  ***Agile is a development methodology that emphasizes transparancy, response to change and***
  ***continuous delivery. The benefit of this is that the project can be changed based on***
  ***needs of the client, it also helps with time managment and allows for greater***
  ***flexibility through modularity.***  
  
* Why did you choose Sparta Global?
  ***I chose Sparta Global because of both their impressive growth over the last 5 years,***
  ***with the company having doubled their employee count and their awe-inspiring list ***
  ***of reputable clients. I value the experience and knowledge that I can gain from such***
  ***a well reveiwed and highly respected company.***

* What is SCRUM and what is the benefit of implementing it?
  ***SCRUM is an implementation of agile which uses regular sprints consisting of user***
  ***stories as well as retrospectives to increment through a project on a regular basis***
  ***It's beneficial because it's highly adaptive to new requirements and it is fully***
  ***transparent. This allows every user to have a broad understanding of the work that***
  ***must be achieved and how they should implement it.***
  
* Where do you see yourself in 2-5 years time?
  ***For the next two years I intend to persue the oppertunities given to me by Sparta Global***
  ***as a DevOps consultant. After that I would like to progress to being a full time DevOps***
  ***engineer, ideally with the company I am eventually contracted to. I then intend to grow***  
  ***my knowledge and skills for 2-3 years and eventally persue a role as a senior DevOps***
  ***engineer. However if an oppertunity comes along that I find attractive, I could see***
  ***myself leaving this path for another.***
